# Hi there, I'm Soumia üëã 

## üí´ About Me

I'm a builder at heart‚Äîpassionate about crafting elegant solutions through code. Whether it's designing scalable data pipelines, architecting cloud-native applications, or experimenting with cutting-edge AI models, I thrive on turning complex problems into clean, functional systems.

**Python** is my go-to tool, but my real passion lies in the intersection of **design and engineering**‚Äîcreating apps and systems that are not only powerful but intuitive. From cybersecurity frameworks to generative AI applications, I love diving deep into end-to-end projects that challenge me to think creatively and build iteratively.

With 10+ years across cybersecurity, cloud, data engineering, and AI‚Äîspanning 20+ countries‚ÄîI've learned that the best solutions emerge from collaboration, continuous learning, and a relentless focus on real-world impact. I'm here to share code, learn from the community, and build things that matter.
