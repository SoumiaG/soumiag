# Hi there üëã

## About Me

Over 10+ years, I've navigated the evolving landscape of cybersecurity, cloud, data engineering, and Generative AI‚Äîbuilding scalable, resilient systems that transform how organizations operate. From threat detection frameworks to data pipelines processing millions of events, to AI models driving real-world impact, I focus on solutions that evolve with complexity and scale.

My journey has spanned 20+ countries across Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, working with enterprises and startups on end-to-end projects that demand both strategic vision and hands-on execution. Driven by continuous learning, mentorship, and human-centered values, I thrive at the intersection of cutting-edge innovation and meaningful impact.
